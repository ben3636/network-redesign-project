## Overview
This project has been my “unofficial” capstone and independent research project during the 2020-2021 academic year. At its inception, the overall goal of the project was to create a virtualized lab on my personal network which could provide flexible deployment and access to a variety of virtual machines to use personally and for study. As time progressed however, I began to realize I wanted to do more than just create the lab setup with the virtual hosts. 

Recently completing my final semester at Champlain College’s CNCS (Computer Networking & Cybersecurity) program, I have been exposed to a wide array of security topics and practices in the classroom. I have also completed many hands-on labs working with these concepts in guided environments (courtesy of Champlain’s “upside-down” curriculum). While these guided labs provided me with experiential knowledge about the topics I’ve spent the last four years studying, they were often done in simplified/temporary environments built specifically for the learning targets. This simplification is consistent to that of a flight simulator. The simulator is helpful and allows the student to learn the basics but is not a replacement for flying a real plane. Demonstrating true proficiency requires a real environment with the training wheels off.

At this point, the goal of the project shifted to demonstrating my understanding of everything that I have learned during my perusal of my CNCS Bachelor's Degree. The final result would cover everything from first-year networking fundamentals all the way up to fourth-year network security implementations. The project would encompass the process of setting up the physical server/cabling and high-level design of the networks and security implementations to be actually used as my primary network and machines (not just for short-term testing/demo).
